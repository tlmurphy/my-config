# Instructions

1. Copy `.zshrc` file into home directory.
2. Create `.config/` directory under home directory if it doesn't already exist.
3. Copy `*.zsh` files under the `.config/` directory.
4. For WSL, follow directions in dircolors.md.

## Mac Notes:

### Pure Prompt
* Install it via npm.
* Make sure you're using the zsh shell installed from brew.
* chsh is a little buggy with hyper and may require a restart (hyper issue?)
* homebrew stores things in `/opt/homebrew/bin` now instead of `/usr/local/bin`
